	This project, titled NDVoters, uses QT Creator to generate an interactive GUI that allows the user to view graphs about the political atmosphere at Notre Dame. The user is able to view side-by-side graphs about Presidential Primary voting patterns for different demographics. To run the program after it has already been compiled, the user must first run the executable, NDVoters. Once this executable is run, the GUI will open, initially displaying two side-by-side graphs of the total votes for each candidate. There are drop down menus for each bar of the side-by-side graph. The user can select different drop downs to change the graphs. For example, the user could select "Female" from the gender dropdown menu for the left bar, and then select "Male" from the gender dropdown menu for the right bar. After clicking the "Create Graph" button, the user would see a comparison of the voting patterns of each gender. The user can change as many dropdowns as desired to make the graphed voting populations more or less specific. To return to showing the total overall votes for all voters, the user must simply change each dropdown back to the default choice ("Age", "Gender", etc.). At any point, the user can press the "Quit" button to close the GUI and exit the program.
