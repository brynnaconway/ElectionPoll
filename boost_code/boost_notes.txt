Boost Graph Library

-Boost Graph Library is a generic interface that allows access to a graph's structure, but hides the details of the implementation
-“open” interface: any graph library that implements this interface will be interoperable with the BGL generic algorithms and with other algorithms that also use this interface
-Boost Graph Library is a header-only library and does not need to be built to be used
-be sure to compile with optimization -02 or -03
-The BGL currently provides two graph classes and an edge list adaptor
adjacency_list
adjacency_matrix
edge_list
